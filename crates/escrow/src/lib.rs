//! # Soroban Forge — Escrow contract
//!
//! A three-party escrow that **holds real tokens**: a `buyer`, a `seller`,
//! and an `arbiter` agree on an `amount` of a single SEP-41 token and a
//! `timeout`. The buyer funds the escrow on-chain, and the contract
//! custodies the tokens until release, refund, or arbitration:
//!
//! ```text
//! Pending --deposit--> Funded --release--> Completed (seller paid)
//!                     |        --refund--> Refunded  (buyer back)
//!                     |        --refund_expired--> Refunded (keeper-triggered after deadline)
//! Pending --deposit--> Funded --release_partial (×n)--> Funded  (partial)
//!                     |                                  |
//!                     |                                  +--> Completed (final partial)
//!                     |        --release--> Completed (full, direct)
//!                     |        --refund--> Refunded   (buyer back, remaining only)
//!                     |        --dispute--> Disputed --resolve--> Completed | Refunded
//!          --cancel--> Cancelled (before funding only)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Partial releases
//!
//! `release_partial(escrow_id, amount)` allows the seller to receive funds
//! incrementally while the escrow remains `Funded`. The accounting is:
//!
//! ```text
//! remaining = deposited - released
//! ```
//!
//! * Each `release_partial` transfers exactly `amount` to the seller and
//!   increments `released` by that amount.
//! * When `amount == remaining` (the final partial payment), the escrow
//!   transitions to `Completed` exactly once.
//! * `refund` and `resolve` operate on the **remaining** balance only.
//! * The existing `release` entrypoint pays the full remaining balance in
//!   one shot and is unchanged; it still transitions directly to `Completed`.
//!
//! ## Multi-asset baskets
//!
//! A single token per escrow cannot express the trades that actually happen:
//! a listing settled in a primary token plus a supplementary voucher, or a
//! swap where each side posts a different asset. `create_basket` +
//! `deposit_basket` / `release_basket` / `refund_basket` / `resolve_basket`
//! hold `Vec<EscrowAsset>` instead of one `(token, amount)` pair, under
//! `DataKey::Basket(id)`.
//!
//! **The single-token path is untouched.** `EscrowData`, `DataKey::Escrow(id)`,
//! and every existing event keep their exact shape, so a basket is additive
//! and no indexer, ABI consumer, or stored record has to change. Both record
//! kinds draw from the **same** `DataKey::Count` id sequence, so an id names
//! exactly one escrow of exactly one kind and the two can never collide.
//!
//! The two kinds are *not* two state machines. Every transfer shape the
//! contract has — pull the whole basket in, pay the whole basket out, pay one
//! leg out — is a single free function ([`pull_assets`], [`payout_assets`],
//! [`payout_part`]) that both kinds call. A single-token escrow reaches them
//! through a one-element asset list, so the terminal paths cannot drift:
//! there is one conservation rule, not two.
//!
//! ### Decisions
//!
//! 1. **Partial-deposit policy: all-or-nothing.** `deposit_basket` pulls every
//!    leg in list order and the host frame rolls the whole invocation back if
//!    any leg fails, so the basket never becomes `Funded` holding only some of
//!    its assets. A half-funded basket would make every downstream balance
//!    ambiguous, and "which assets made it in" would have to be re-derived by
//!    every consumer. The caller sees the escrow still `Pending` and retries
//!    the whole deposit.
//! 2. **Duplicate tokens: rejected, not merged.** `create_basket` returns
//!    `InvalidInput` when a token appears twice. Merging would make the result
//!    depend on merge order and would silently change what the buyer agreed to
//!    authorize; rejecting keeps the basket a literal description of the terms.
//! 3. **Basket size: at most [`MAX_BASKET_ASSETS`] (8) legs.** Each leg is a
//!    cross-contract call plus a stored entry, and both are metered by the
//!    ledger. The bound keeps one escrow inside Soroban's instruction and
//!    state budgets, and the pairwise duplicate scan is quadratic but trivial
//!    at this size.
//! 4. **TTL: per escrow, never per asset.** The whole basket is one persistent
//!    entry, so `touch_ttl` extends it as a unit and a basket can never be
//!    half-expired — no asset can outlive or expire without the others.
//! 5. **Resolve is all-or-nothing per asset, one direction for all.** A
//!    basket resolve pays *every* leg to the seller or *every* leg to the
//!    buyer, mirroring the existing `bool` decision. Per-asset or
//!    basis-point splits are deliberately out of scope (they are the separate
//!    split-award feature); a `bool` cannot honestly express them.
//!
//! ### Accounting
//!
//! Each [`EscrowAsset`] carries its own `amount` / `released` pair, so
//! per-asset accounting is the *same* rule as the single-token `EscrowData`
//! accounting it generalizes (`remaining = amount - released`) applied per leg.
//! A basket reaches `Completed` only when **every** leg is fully released; a
//! partial release that empties one leg of a two-leg basket leaves the basket
//! `Funded` with a zero-balance leg. `refund` and `resolve` settle whatever
//! remains across all legs in list order.
//!
//! ## Storage compatibility
//!
//! `EscrowData` now carries a `released: i128` field. Records written by
//! earlier contract versions do not contain this field. Soroban
//! `#[contracttype]` structs are stored as XDR symbol-keyed maps; the host's
//! `map_unpack_to_slice` rejects any map whose entry count differs from the
//! struct's field count. To stay backward compatible while keeping
//! `DataKey::Escrow(id)` unchanged, `load_escrow` attempts to deserialize the
//! stored value as the current `EscrowData` first, and on failure falls back
//! to deserializing as `EscrowDataV1` (the pre-partial-release shape) and
//! converts it by defaulting `released` to `0`. No migration is required;
//! the conversion happens lazily on first read, and the upgraded record is
//! written back at the same key on the next state-changing call.
//!
//! **Document of record:** the chosen strategy is a two-type fallback decode
//! inside `load_escrow`. `EscrowDataV1` is the exact nine-field struct that
//! existed before this feature. It carries no `released` field and is never
//! written by new code. On a successful `EscrowDataV1` decode the result is
//! immediately upcast to `EscrowData` with `released = 0`.
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! A new `PartiallyReleased` event is emitted by `release_partial` rather
//! than reusing `Released`. The two events carry different semantics: a
//! `Released` event signals terminal completion; a `PartiallyReleased` event
//! signals an incremental payout with a non-zero remaining balance (except
//! when it is also the final partial, in which case the `EscrowData` in the
//! payload will carry `status = Completed`). Extending the existing `Released`
//! event would silently break existing indexers that treat `Released` as a
//! terminal signal.
//!
//! ## Custody model
//!
//! On `deposit`, the token contract moves `amount` from the buyer to this
//! contract's own address. From that moment the funds are inside the
//! contract and can only leave via `release` / `release_partial` (to
//! seller), `refund` (to buyer), or `resolve` (either, by arbiter decision).
//! There is no admin key and no other exit.
//!
//! ## Ordering discipline (load-bearing)
//!
//! Every method that moves tokens performs the token transfer **first**
//! and writes state **after** the transfer succeeds. A failed transfer
//! reverts the whole invocation with storage untouched — there is no
//! state/ledger divergence window and no recovery path needed. The
//! inverse ordering (state first, transfer second) would strand funds
//! behind a failed transfer and is the classic escrow bug.
//!
//! ## Authorization model
//!
//! - `create_escrow` — **buyer only**. The seller is recorded but does
//!   not authorize creation: nothing of theirs is at risk before funding,
//!   their consent is expressed by the refund path (they can return funds
//!   at any time pre-deadline), and requiring their signature at creation
//!   forces a two-signer transaction that is hostile to wallets and CLI
//!   flows (this was learned live: a two-auth create produced `TxBadAuth`
//!   on every standard signing path during the testnet demo).
//! - `deposit` — buyer authorizes; their authorization covers the nested
//!   token pull.
//! - `release` — seller authorizes, confirming delivery. The buyer
//!   authorizing their own payout would make this a confirmation flow,
//!   not escrow.
//! - `release_partial` — **seller authorizes**, same rationale as `release`.
//!   Invalid requests (zero/negative amount, amount > remaining, non-Funded
//!   status) return `InvalidInput` without modifying storage.
//! - `refund` — seller before the deadline; buyer may reclaim after the
//!   deadline.
//! - `refund_expired` — permissionless after the deadline; pays the buyer
//!   and cannot settle a disputed escrow.
//! - `dispute` — the **claimant** (buyer or seller) is passed explicitly
//!   and must be one of the two parties; their `require_auth` proves the
//!   claim. Soroban has no "auth by A-or-B" primitive, so an explicit
//!   claimant parameter is the honest way to express either-party
//!   authorization.
//! - `resolve` — arbiter only; the decision is final.
//! - `cancel` — buyer, while `Pending`.
//!
//! ## Storage and TTL
//!
//! Each escrow is its own **persistent** entry (`DataKey::Escrow(id)`)
//! so the byte budget scales per record. Every participant's creation-order
//! index is likewise a **persistent** per-party entry
//! (`DataKey::ParticipantIndex(Address)`), written once per escrow creation:
//! a party's id list grows with their escrow count, so it cannot live in
//! instance storage (one party's growth would tax every shared instance
//! read). The only instance entry is the id counter. Every write bumps the
//! entry's TTL with the standard threshold/extend-to pattern, and
//! `touch_ttl` is a permissionless keeper entrypoint for escrows that sit
//! idle near expiry.
//!
//! The participant index contains every non-cancelled escrow for each
//! distinct buyer, seller, or arbiter. A successful `cancel` removes its id
//! from each distinct party's list after state and authorization checks,
//! preserving survivor order. Other terminal paths (`release`, `refund`,
//! and `resolve`) retain their ids because those escrow records remain
//! addressable. Pagination is live offset/limit, not a frozen snapshot:
//! removing an earlier id shifts later ids left, so a saved cursor can skip
//! an id. Clients should restart from cursor zero after mutation.

// WASM target guard: SDK 27 contracts must be built for wasm32v1-none.
// wasm32-unknown-unknown (os=unknown) can emit features the Soroban
// runtime rejects; wasm32v1-none (os=none) is the supported target.
