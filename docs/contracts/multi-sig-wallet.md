## Interface

```rust
fn initialize(owners: Vec<Address>, threshold: u32) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn submit(submitter: Address, target: Address, payload: Bytes, expiry: Option<u64>) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn submit_call(submitter: Address, target: Address, fn_name: Symbol, args: Vec<Val>, expiry: Option<u64>) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn confirm(tx_id: u64, signer: Address) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn reject(tx_id: u64, signer: Address) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn execute(tx_id: u64) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn get_tx(tx_id: u64) -> Result<WalletTx, ForgeError>
fn is_live(tx_id: u64) -> bool
fn is_tx_live(tx_id: u64) -> bool
fn add_owner(proposer: Address, new_owner: Address) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn remove_owner(proposer: Address, owner: Address) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn set_threshold(proposer: Address, new_threshold: u32) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
```

The wallet is configured **once** via `initialize(owners, threshold)`
(first caller wins; re-initialisation is rejected). `submit` records a
`target` contract and an opaque payload with an optional `expiry` timestamp (`None` for immortal transactions); `submit_call` does the same for typed contract invocations. `confirm` collects approvals until
the threshold is reached; `execute` then performs a real cross-contract
invocation to the recorded target (an opaque `TxKind::Data` tx) or moves
real tokens (a typed `TxKind::Withdrawal` tx). A target revert surfaces as
`ForgeError::ContractInvocationFailed` and leaves the tx `Pending` and
retryable. Any owner may `reject` a pending tx; one rejection immediately
makes it `Rejected` and terminal. The rejector and any existing confirmations
remain on the record for audit, and `get_tx` continues to expose it.
Confirming, rejecting, or executing a rejected transaction returns
`ForgeError::InvalidInput` without changing the record.
`ForgeError::ContractInvocationFailed` and leaves the tx `Pending` and retryable. `reject` records a formal objection; any rejection blocks
execution, and reaching the rejection threshold makes the tx `Rejected`
(terminal). If a transaction expires before meeting threshold, its status transitions lazily to `Expired` and further confirmations are refused.

## Transaction metadata

Transactions carry optional metadata for treasury context (accounting
references, human-readable descriptions, off-chain documentation links):

- `memo: String` - optional short human-readable description, max 128 chars.
- `metadata: String` - optional extended information blob, max 512 chars.

Both fields are stored on the transaction record at submission time and
preserved through the transaction lifecycle (`Pending` -> `Executed` /
`Rejected`). They are returned by `get_tx` and the queue views. Submission
rejects over-length values with `ForgeError::InvalidInput`. Metadata is not
encrypted and no on-chain document storage is performed; use external
IPFS/URLs for large payloads. The `submit` event includes a metadata hash
for verification.

## Transaction query views

The wallet exposes read-only views for loading the transaction queue without
one contract call per transaction:

```rust
fn get_transactions(offset: u32, limit: u32) -> Result<Vec<WalletTx>, ForgeError>
fn get_transactions_by_status(
    status: TxStatus,
    offset: u32,
    limit: u32,
) -> Result<Vec<WalletTx>, ForgeError>
```

Both return transactions in ascending `tx_id` order. For
`get_transactions`, `offset` is zero-based in the complete sequence (so
offset `0` starts at transaction id `1`). For
`get_transactions_by_status`, `offset` is zero-based among transactions
matching the requested status. Each returns at most `limit` records; ranges
past the end return an empty vector or the remaining records. A `limit` of
zero returns `ForgeError::InvalidInput`. An uninitialized or empty wallet
returns an empty vector for a positive limit. These views do not require
authorization and do not modify contract state.

Additional views: `get_threshold`, `get_owners`, `is_owner`,
`get_confirmations`, `get_rejections`, `get_tx_count`, `get_tx`, and the
per-token views `get_withdrawal_limit` / `get_withdrawal_window` /
`get_window_usage` / `check_withdrawal` / `balance`.

## Withdrawal-limit views

```rust
fn get_withdrawal_limit(token: Address) -> Option<WithdrawalLimit>
fn get_withdrawal_window(token: Address) -> WindowState
fn check_withdrawal(token: Address, amount: i128) -> CheckResult
```

These views require no authorization and do not modify or prune storage.
`get_withdrawal_limit` returns `None` when no policy is configured. The
window view reports the active total (including pending withdrawals), the
oldest active submission time as `window_start`, and that entry's projected
expiry as `reset_at`. Entries expire at `submitted_at + window_seconds`, so
they still count one second before reset and are excluded exactly at reset.
As entries expire at different times, `reset_at` describes the next expiry,
not a time when the entire total necessarily becomes zero. With no configured
limit, no active entries, an unknown token, or an uninitialized wallet, the
window is empty (`total = 0`, timestamps absent). Removing a limit makes the
limit and window views return `None` and an empty window; retained history is
still used if a limit is configured again.

`check_withdrawal` returns `CheckResult::Allowed` or a denial variant:
`WalletNotInitialized`, `InvalidAmount`, `LimitExceeded`,
`InsufficientFunds`, or `ArithmeticOverflow`. It checks initialization,
positive amount, the same rolling-limit arithmetic as submission, then the
wallet's recorded custody balance. This is a snapshot at the current ledger
timestamp, not a promise about later execution: submission reserves window
capacity, while custody funding is rechecked when the approved transaction
executes. The generated TypeScript client has not been regenerated for these
new views; future client regeneration will include them.

Example: with a 1,000-unit limit per 600 seconds, a 700-unit withdrawal
submitted at timestamp 10,000 produces `total = 700`, `window_start = 10,000`,
and `reset_at = 10,600`. A check for 400 at 10,599 returns
`CheckResult::LimitExceeded`, matching submission enforcement. At 10,600 the
700-unit entry is expired; the same check is allowed if the wallet has enough
recorded balance.

## States

- `Pending` — Awaiting approvals
- `Executed` — Threshold met and the transaction completed
- `Rejected` — Vetoed by an owner; terminal; rejector and existing confirmations retained
- `Pending` — Awaiting approvals; liveness view `is_live(tx_id)` reads `true`.
- `Executed` — Threshold met and the transaction completed (terminal).
- `Rejected` — Rejection threshold met (terminal).
- `Expired` — Expiry deadline reached before meeting approval threshold; evaluated lazily on read/access without requiring an external keeper.

### Transaction Lifecycle and Expiry Semantics

Transactions can optionally specify an `expiry: Option<u64>` (ledger timestamp) upon submission (`None` preserves immortal behavior):
- **Submission validation**: Submitting with `expiry <= env.ledger().timestamp()` is rejected with `ForgeError::DeadlineReached`.
- **Lazy evaluation**: When accessing a transaction (`get_tx`, `is_live`, etc.), if `now >= expiry` and confirmations have not reached `threshold`, the transaction status surfaces lazily as `TxStatus::Expired`.
- **Liveness commitment**: A transaction that reaches the confirmation threshold *before* its expiry deadline remains executable even after the deadline passes (`execute` succeeds; status remains `Pending` until execution completes).
- **Boundary-pinned confirmation**: Approvals (`confirm`) attempted at or after the expiry deadline (`now >= expiry`) are rejected with `ForgeError::DeadlineReached`, leaving the transaction's confirmation set unchanged.
- **Terminal guard**: `execute` and `reject` calls on an expired transaction fail with `ForgeError::DeadlineReached`.
- **Queue query**: `get_transactions_by_status(TxStatus::Expired, ...)` paginates expired transactions seamlessly.

| State Transition | Before Expiry | At Expiry Boundary (`now == expiry`) | After Expiry (`now > expiry`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Pending` (below threshold) | `Pending`, `is_live == true` | `Expired`, `is_live == false` | `Expired`, `is_live == false` |
| `confirm` | Succeeds, records approval | Fails (`DeadlineReached`) | Fails (`DeadlineReached`) |
| `execute` (below threshold) | Fails (`InvalidInput`) | Fails (`DeadlineReached`) | Fails (`DeadlineReached`) |
| `Pending` (threshold met before expiry) | `Pending`, executable | `Pending`, executable | `Pending`, executable |
| `execute` (threshold met before expiry) | Succeeds -> `Executed` | Succeeds -> `Executed` | Succeeds -> `Executed` |

## Storage & TWL Maintenance

Transaction records (`DataKey::Tx(u64)`) are stored in **persistent
storage**: `submit`, `confirm`, `reject`, `execute`, `submit_withdrawal`,
and the limit-change paths write through `.persistent()` and bump the
entry's TWL to a 30-day horizon on every write. `get_tx` reads from
persistent storage. Owners, threshold, per-token balances, and withdrawal
limits remain in instance storage.

A permissionless public keeper entrypoint `touch_tx_ttl(tx_id)` allows
anyone to bump a transaction's persistent TTL without modifying its state;
an unknown `tx_id` returns `ForgeError::NotFound`. A separate
`touch_ttl(token)` keeper extends the persistent balance entries' TTL.
