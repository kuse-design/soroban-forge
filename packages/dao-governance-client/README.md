# @soroban-forge/dao-governance-client

Generated TypeScript client for the **Soroban Forge DAO governance contract**:
proposal lifecycle (propose → vote → execute) with refundable proposal bonds.

The client is generated **offline** from the contract's WASM ABI by the Stellar
CLI, so every method is fully typed and carries the doc comments from the
contract source.

Before proposals can be created, initialize the deployed contract with both
`configure_bond` and `configure_category_rules`. After changing the contract
interface, regenerate this client with `bash scripts/generate-clients.sh`.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # emits dist/
```

## Usage

```ts
import { Client } from "@soroban-forge/dao-governance-client";

const client = new Client({
  rpcUrl: "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org", // or your own RPC
  networkPassphrase: "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
  contractId: "…", // the deployed contract id
});

// Every contract method is available, typed, with `try*` variants:
const id = await client.propose({ proposer, target, action, duration });
// Or select a configured voting category:
const financialId = await client.propose_with_category({
  proposer,
  target,
  action,
  category: { tag: "Financial", values: undefined },
});
await client.vote({ proposal_id: id.result, voter, support });
await client.execute({ proposal_id: id.result });
```

Signers/wallets are supplied per call via `MethodOptions` (`sign`, `simulate`,
etc.) — see the
[stellar-sdk contract client docs](https://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-sdk/).

## Provenance

Regenerate after any contract interface change:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-clients.sh
```

The script rebuilds the contract WASM and runs
`stellar contract bindings typescript --wasm … --output-dir packages/dao-governance-client --overwrite`.
