# Development Guide

This guide covers the development workflow for Soroban Forge. All commands documented here are tested and work in the current repository.

## Prerequisites

### Developer CLI (soroban-forge)

Build and run the developer CLI:

```bash
# Build CLI binary
cargo build --locked -p soroban-forge-cli

# Scaffold a new Soroban contract crate
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- new my-token

# Scaffold with custom path
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- new my-token --path ./custom/path/my-token
```

The generated crate is a standalone project that compiles with `cargo check`
without depending on the workspace layout or a stale shared-utils version pin.

Run the local environment preflight before deploying a contract:

```bash
# Check stellar, cargo, and the wasm32v1-none target
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- doctor

# Also verify that a selected artifact exists and is non-empty
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- doctor \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_forge_escrow.wasm
```

`doctor` never installs tools or performs network checks. It runs every check in order and prints
PASS/FAIL rows plus an exact remediation command for each failure. `stellar --version` and
`cargo --version` are reported when available; if an existing binary returns a non-zero status or
no usable version, the check remains PASS with `version unknown`. The target check only passes when
`rustup target list --installed` succeeds and includes `wasm32v1-none`. The optional artifact check
distinguishes a missing path, directory, empty file, and filesystem error. Any required failure
causes the command to exit non-zero and lists the failed checks in the summary.

```bash
# Install or update Rust
rustup update stable

# Install required components
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Add WASM target required by soroban-sdk
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
```

### Soroban CLI (Optional)

For deployment and contract interaction:

```bash
cargo install soroban-cli
```

### soroban-sdk Version

The project uses soroban-sdk 27.x. See `rust-toolchain.toml` for the exact pinned version.

## Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Meet-hybrid/soroban-forge.git
cd soroban-forge

# Verify workspace loads
cargo metadata --locked --no-deps --format-version 1 > /dev/null
```

## Build Commands

### Full Workspace Build

```bash
make build
# or: cargo build --workspace --all-targets --locked
```

### Release Build (WASM Artifacts)

```bash
cargo build --locked --release --target wasm32v1-none -p soroban-forge-escrow
# Builds: target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_forge_escrow.wasm
```

### Build All Contracts for Release

```bash
cargo build --locked --release --target wasm32v1-none \
  --package soroban-forge-escrow \
  --package soroban-forge-vesting \
  --package soroban-forge-multi-sig-wallet \
  --package soroban-forge-dao-governance \
  --package soroban-forge-subscription-payments \
  --package soroban-forge-marketplace-royalties
```

### Build and Check WASM with the Developer CLI

The CLI can build one contract or all six contract packages for the required
`wasm32v1-none` target. WASM builds always use the optimized release profile.
Use `--package` to select a single package; without it, the CLI builds all
contract packages and skips the host-only CLI and shared utility crates.

```bash
# Build all contract WASM artifacts
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- build --wasm

# Build one contract and verify its artifact against the 150,000-byte budget
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- build --wasm --check-size \
  --package soroban-forge-escrow

# Build all contracts and print a size table; --check-size implies --wasm
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- build --check-size
```

Size verification inspects `.wasm` files under
`target/wasm32v1-none/release/` (or `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/wasm32v1-none/release/`
when `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set). It reports each artifact's byte and KB size,
the 150,000-byte budget, and a `PASS` or `FAIL` status. If any artifact exceeds
the budget, or no artifact is found for the selected package, the command exits
with an error. If the target is missing, install it with
`rustup target add wasm32v1-none` and rerun the build.

Example output:

```text
Contract                                  Size (bytes)   Size (KB)   Budget (bytes)  Status
----------------------------------------  ------------  ----------  ---------------  ------
soroban_forge_dao_governance.wasm                12309       12.02           150000  PASS
soroban_forge_escrow.wasm                        20425       19.94           150000  PASS
soroban_forge_marketplace_royalties.wasm         15099       14.74           150000  PASS
soroban_forge_multi_sig_wallet.wasm              23571       23.01           150000  PASS
soroban_forge_subscription_payments.wasm         10877       10.62           150000  PASS
soroban_forge_vesting.wasm                       14596       14.25           150000  PASS
```

### Verify WASM Artifacts against the Provenance Manifest

`provenance-manifest.json` (generated by `scripts/provenance.sh`) records the
lowercase SHA-256 of every contract artifact built from a clean rebuild. The
`verify` subcommand rebuilds a package deterministically and compares the
result against a supplied hash, the manifest, or both:

```bash
# Verify one artifact against the provenance manifest (default manifest path:
# provenance-manifest.json in the current directory)
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- verify --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_forge_escrow.wasm

# Rebuild a package and check its fresh artifact matches an expected hash
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- verify --expected <64-hex-sha256> --package soroban-forge-escrow

# Check every artifact in the manifest
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- verify --manifest provenance-manifest.json
```

`--wasm <PATH>` hashes the given artifact on disk (SHA-256) and optionally
compares it against `--expected` or the manifest entry for the package
inferred from the file name (`soroban_forge_escrow.wasm` →
`soroban-forge-escrow`). `--expected` triggers a deterministic rebuild of the
selected package and compares the resulting artifact's hash. `--manifest`
verifies every artifact listed in the manifest by rebuilding each package.
All comparisons are exact; any mismatch (or a rebuild that fails) exits
non-zero. `--package` selects a single package; without it, artifacts are
matched by name inference.

## TypeScript Clients

All six contracts ship generated TypeScript bindings under `packages/*-client`
(`@soroban-forge/escrow-client` lives in `packages/typescript-sdk`, the five
newer contracts each have their own package directory). The bindings are
produced **offline** from each contract's WASM — no deployed contract id is
needed — using the pinned Stellar CLI's `contract bindings typescript --wasm`.

Regenerate everything with a single command:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-clients.sh
```

The script:

1. Builds all six contract crates for `wasm32v1-none` (`--locked --release`).
2. For each contract, wipes its package directory and runs
   `stellar contract bindings typescript --wasm <wasm> --output-dir <pkg> --overwrite`.
3. Leaves the generated output ready to commit; consumers do not need the
   Soroban toolchain to install or build the packages.

Build a client package (or the Next.js demo that depends on the escrow client):

```bash
cd packages/typescript-sdk && npm install && npm run build
cd packages/nextjs-example && npm install && npm run build
```

The mapping of contract → package directory lives in
`scripts/generate-clients.sh`; keep it in sync with `scripts/provenance.sh`
(the crate list is duplicated deliberately so the build stays explicit).

## Contract Testing Notes

- Tests use Soroban SDK's `Env` test harness
- Mock authentication (`mock_all_auths`) for positive tests
- Integration tests use Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) fixtures
- Escrow includes property testing for conservation invariant

## Escrow Storage, TTL, and Token Trust

### Persistent storage and TTL

Escrow records are stored as per-id **persistent** entries. Each record is
extended to a **30-day TTL** when it is written. State-changing escrow
operations that update the record extend the entry's TTL using the same
threshold-and-extend-to pattern. `touch_ttl` is permissionless and can extend
an existing entry while it remains present in persistent storage.

An active escrow with no state-changing activity can eventually reach expiry.
Once the persistent escrow entry has expired, `touch_ttl` cannot recover it:
the current implementation calls `load_escrow` before attempting the TTL
extension, and a missing entry is reported as `NotFound` (the id never
existed, or its persistent entry was archived). `ttl_info(escrow_id)` is a
read-only keeper view of the remaining ledgers; poll it and call
`touch_ttl` while the escrow is still present and its TTL approaches the
29-day bump threshold. SDK 27 does not expose host TTL introspection to
contracts, so the contract mirrors each escrow expiration ledger in a
companion persistent key and updates it alongside the escrow's 30-day TTL
bumps. The test-only `get_ttl` host helper checks this mirror in tests.

If `ttl_info` or `touch_ttl` returns `NotFound`, determine whether the id
never existed or its escrow entry was archived. A keeper cannot restore an
archived entry through a contract call. Prepare a transaction whose Soroban
footprint includes the escrow data key in `readWrite`, simulate it to populate
resource and fee data, and submit a standalone `RestoreFootprintOp`; after
restoration confirms, invoke the contract again to read the record and
continue the recovery flow. On Protocol 23 and later, a simulated invocation
may include archived entries in its restore list and restore them
automatically; the standalone operation is useful when restoration fees
should be paid separately. Restoring the record does not move escrow funds:
they remain at the escrow contract's address in the token contract, and any
payout still requires a successful contract invocation against restored
state. Keeper calls are permissionless.

### Subscription records

`subscription-payments` stores each `DataKey::Subscription(id)` record in
persistent storage and extends it to 30 days whenever subscribe, charge,
charge catch-up, pause, resume, or cancel writes the record. The threshold is
29 days, following the same extend-to pattern as escrow. The `Count` counter
and the subscriber/provider enumeration indexes remain in instance storage.
Any account may call `touch_ttl(subscription_id)` to extend a present record;
it returns `NotFound` when the id is absent. Keepers should touch long-lived
subscriptions before their TTL approaches expiry. This storage cutover
assumes no deployed mainnet instance contains live subscription records.

### Token trust model

`create_escrow` accepts a user-specified token address. The escrow does not
validate whether that address is a deployed token contract and does not itself
enforce SEP-41 compliance. The design assumes the supplied token follows the
expected SEP-41 interface and behavior. Token transfer failures are handled
through the existing `ForgeError::TokenTransferFailed` path. A malicious or
non-compliant token is an external trust assumption, not a condition that the
escrow currently validates against.

## CI Pipeline

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs:

1. **rustfmt** - Code formatting check
2. **clippy** - Linting with strict warnings
3. **build** - Full workspace build + docs
4. **test** - Test suite execution
5. **audit** - Dependency vulnerability scan
6. **dependency-policy** - License, source, and ban checks
7. **wasm-size** - Contract size budget enforcement
8. **provenance** - Build reproducibility verification

ForgeBot (`.github/workflows/forgebot.yml`, `scripts/forgebot/`) reports these
results back to each pull request as a single sticky comment and publishes an
informational `ForgeBot / ready-for-review` commit status. It does not add or
replace any check, and it never approves or merges a pull request. See
[ForgeBot](FORGEBOT.md) for details.

### Dependency Policy (cargo-deny)

Soroban Forge enforces a dependency policy via [cargo-deny](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/) to ensure compliance with license compatibility, source integrity, and ban policies.

**Policy:**

- **Licenses**: Only permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Unicode, CC0) are allowed. GPL/AGPL/SSPL are denied.
- **Sources**: All dependencies must come from crates.io; git and path dependencies are banned to prevent supply-chain surprises.
- **Bans**: Multiple versions of the same crate are flagged; justified exceptions are documented in `deny.toml`.

**Configuration:**
The policy is defined in [deny.toml](../../deny.toml) at the workspace root. Each non-default choice is commented to explain the rationale.

**Running checks locally:**

```bash
# Install cargo-deny
cargo install --locked cargo-deny

# Check licenses
cargo deny check licenses

# Check sources
cargo deny check sources

# Check bans and duplicates
cargo deny check bans
```

**Adding exceptions:**
If a dependency legitimately requires an exception (e.g., an older crate with an undeclared license, or a tool-only dev dependency), add it to `deny.toml` with a clear comment explaining why it is justified. Example:

```toml
[licenses]
exceptions = [
    # { name = "crate-name", allow = ["MIT"] },  # Reason: <justification>
]
```

All exceptions must be reviewed and approved before merge.

## Common Issues

### WASM Build Fails

Ensure `wasm32v1-none` target is installed:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
```

### Lock File Conflicts

Use `--locked` flag to ensure reproducible builds:

```bash
cargo build --locked
```

### Clippy Failures

The project uses `-D warnings` (fail on warnings). Fix issues reported by clippy or document intentional deviations.

## WASM Size Budget

Contracts have a maximum size of 150,000 bytes. This is enforced in CI.
