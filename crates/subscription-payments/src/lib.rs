//! # Soroban Forge — Subscription Payments contract
//!
//! Recurring, on-chain subscription billing: a subscriber authorises a
//! provider to pull a fixed `amount` per `period` (seconds) from a token
//! balance using SEP-41 tokens. The contract tracks subscription state,
//! billing cadence, token settlement, pause/resume, arrears retry handling,
//! and metered usage (per-metric quotas with exact overage pricing).
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! subscribe -> Active <-> Paused
//!                 \         /
//!                  v       v
//!                   cancel -> Cancelled (no further charges)
//! subscribe -> Active --(period elapses, charge succeeds)--> bills amount, advances
//!            -> Active --(period elapses, charge fails)---> PastDue (arrears retry)
//!            -> PastDue --(retry exceeds max retries)-----> Cancelled
//!            -> cancel -> Cancelled (no further charges)
//! ```
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `subscribe` requires the subscriber (who authorises the agreement).
//! - `authorize_provider` requires the subscriber (who consents to the
//!   provider-initiated relationship).
//! - `revoke_provider` requires the subscriber (who withdraws that consent).
//! - `subscribe_on_behalf_of` requires the provider **and** an explicit
//!   opt-in from the subscriber for that provider.
//! - `charge` requires the provider (who pulls payment) and bills when a
//!   full period has elapsed since the last charge, executing a SEP-41 token
//!   transfer from subscriber to provider in pull mode, or from prepaid
//!   contract custody to provider after a subscriber opts in with `deposit`.
//! - `charge_catchup` requires the provider and atomically bills multiple
//!   elapsed periods, bounded by [`MAX_CATCHUP_PERIODS`]. It refuses
//!   `PastDue` subscriptions so arrears retry semantics remain owned by
//!   `charge`.
//! - `set_quotas` requires the subscriber: quotas price the overage the
//!   subscriber is billed, so the account being charged is the one that
//!   consents to the terms.
//! - `record_usage` requires the provider (the party that served the usage
//!   and meters it, mirroring who is authorized to `charge`).
//! - `pause` requires the subscriber.
//! - `resume` requires the subscriber.
//! - `cancel` requires the subscriber (works from `Active`, `Paused`, or `PastDue`).
//! - read-only views (`get_subscription`, `get_subscription_count`,
//!   `subscriptions_for_subscriber`, `subscriptions_for_provider`,
//!   `is_provider_authorized`) require no authorization.

//!
//! ## Provider opt-in (explicit consent)
//!
//! A provider-initiated subscription (`subscribe_on_behalf_of`) is only
//! accepted for a provider the subscriber has **explicitly authorized** on
//! chain. The consent lives in instance storage under
//! [`DataKey::ProviderOptIn`], keyed by `(subscriber, provider)`; it is
//! written by `authorize_provider` and removed by `revoke_provider`, both
//! of which require the subscriber's authorization.
//!
//! The security property this preserves: a provider cannot create a
//! subscription that can later pull subscriber funds without the
//! subscriber's explicit on-chain consent. `charge` still authorizes
//! through the provider, so a subscription created by `subscribe` (subscriber
//! authorized at creation) remains fully chargeable, while a provider-created
//! subscription can only exist for a relationship the subscriber chose.
//!
//! The opt-in is a narrow, per-relationship flag — not a general permission
//! framework. Both path's records are stored in the same
//! [`Subscription`] shape with the same sequential id counter, so
//! [`get_subscription`] cannot distinguish a subscriber-created from a
//! provider-created record, and no consent-origin field is needed.
//!
//! ## Metered usage: quotas and overage
//!
//! A flat `amount` per period is a one-size-fits-all price. Production
//! products also price *usage*: a base period fee plus included units per
//! metric, with a per-bucket overage price for what exceeds the inclusion
//! (for example "10k API calls included, then 5 stroops per 1k over").
//!
//! - A subscription carries a declared quota list, [`Vec<MetricQuota>`]. An
//!   **empty list is the flat flow**: [`period_amount`] short-circuits to
//!   `amount`, the charged value and every event payload are bit-identical to
//!   a contract without this feature, and the existing regression suite is
//!   unchanged.
//! - The provider meters usage with `record_usage(subscription_id, metric,
//!   units)`, which accumulates **raw units** for the open period only, under
//!   [`DataKey::Usage`]. Recording is rejected for a metric the subscription
//!   does not declare, so a provider can never meter usage the subscriber has
//!   not already been asked to pay for.
//! - The amount a period bills is derived in one place — the pure
//!   [`period_amount`] helper, called by `charge`, by every period of
//!   `charge_catchup`, and by the `quote_period` view:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   amount = base
//!          + Σ over metric of ceil(min(max(0, units - included), cap) / bucket) * overage_price
//!   ```
//!
//!   with `cap` omitted for an uncapped quota. A started bucket is billed in
//!   full and the price is **per bucket**, never per unit, so no sub-unit
//!   price precision is ever lost.
//! - **No rounding drift is possible across periods.** The accumulator holds
//!   raw units and never a bucket count or a carried-over remainder, so each
//!   period's amount is a pure function of that period's units. Charging `N`
//!   periods bills exactly `N` times the per-period derivation — there is no
//!   state in which rounding can compound.
//! - Meters are dropped atomically with the charge that closes the period, in
//!   the same frame that advances `last_charged`. A **failed** transfer
//!   returns before that point, so every meter survives untouched and the
//!   retry re-derives a byte-identical amount.
//! - `charge_catchup` settles the open period **last**: usage can only be
//!   metered into the open (latest) period, so earlier unsettled periods bill
//!   the base amount and only the final one carries overage.
//! - `record_usage` requires an `Active` subscription, which is what freezes
//!   the meter at the attempted amount once a charge has failed and makes the
//!   arrears retry identical to the attempt that failed.
//!
//! ### Design decisions
//!
//! 1. **Cap policy** — a per-metric `max_overage_units` on *billable overage
//!    units*, enforced at settlement by clamping, never by rejecting. A charge
//!    is always billable, so a usage spike cannot wedge a subscription, and
//!    the subscriber's worst case per period is `base + Σ caps`. Rejecting at
//!    `record_usage` time was rejected because refused units would spill into
//!    the next period and break the "current period only" property.
//! 2. **Bucketing / rounding** — integer buckets priced per bucket, rounded
//!    **up** (a started bucket is charged in full), derived from raw units on
//!    every derivation. A cap that is not a multiple of `bucket_units` bills
//!    at most `ceil(cap / bucket_units)` buckets.
//! 3. **Accumulator storage class** — instance storage
//!    ([`DataKey::Usage`]), one entry per `(subscription, metric)`, stamped
//!    with the `last_charged` it belongs to. Instance storage matches the
//!    rest of the crate; the persistent-storage migration with TTL maintenance
//!    is tracked separately and does not change the rollover rules.
