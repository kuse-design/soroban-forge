**Soroban Forge** is a library of reusable Soroban smart-contract foundations
and developer tooling for the Stellar ecosystem — escrow, vesting, multi-
signature wallets, DAO governance, subscription payments, and marketplace
royalties, plus a developer CLI and TypeScript bindings.

## Proof at a glance

The escrow contract is **deployed and verified on Stellar testnet**. Every
step below was executed live; run `bash scripts/demo-testnet.sh` to reproduce
([step-by-step walkthrough with expected output](docs/WALKTHROUGH.md)).

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | create → deposit → release (seller paid 500)           | [create 817950c8…](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/817950c8ad95ecad9636783e5e8e8b8e515f94e3364b63c2c02328ff3b675bb9) · deposit · release |
| 2     | create → deposit → dispute(buyer) → resolve for seller | dispute + resolve transactions                                                                                                                      |
| 3     | create → deposit → dispute(seller) → resolve for buyer | dispute + resolve transactions                                                                                                                      |

After all three rounds: **buyer 500 + seller 1000 = 1500 credit minted; the
contract holds zero** — the on-chain conservation property (`deposited ==
paid out`) verified on a live network, matching the in-repo property test.
The token-transfer event from round 1's deposit is visible in the transaction
linked above: 500 `credit` moved buyer → contract.

### Reproducible escrow smoke harness

The maintained smoke flow is [scripts/demo-testnet.sh](scripts/demo-testnet.sh).
It builds the locked escrow WASM, verifies its SHA-256 against
[docs/testnet/escrow-wasm.sha256](docs/testnet/escrow-wasm.sha256), and writes a
machine-readable receipt. It never creates, funds, prints, or commits keys.

Run the credential-free check on a clean machine:

```bash
bash scripts/demo-testnet.sh --help
bash scripts/demo-testnet.sh --dry-run --receipt artifacts/escrow-smoke-receipt.json
```

For a live `create_escrow → deposit → release` check, provide existing Stellar
CLI identities and explicit `ESCROW_ID` and `TOKEN_ID` values. The live flow
asserts `Completed`, verifies successful transaction receipts contain the
expected lifecycle events, checks buyer/seller/contract conservation, and
records transaction hashes in the JSON receipt. See the
[reviewer walkthrough](docs/WALKTHROUGH.md) for the complete command.

> Honest notes: testnet only (no mainnet deployment); the smoke harness uses
> caller-provided CLI identities and never manages private keys; two-auth
> escrow creation was deliberately **rejected as a design** — a live
> `TxBadAuth` on every standard signing path during this demo motivated the
> buyer-only creation flow. See [docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md).

The goal is simple: stop rewriting the same contracts for every project. Pick a
well-documented foundation, audit it for your use case, and ship.

> **Status:** This project is under active development. The contracts are **not
> independently audited** and should not be treated as production-ready without
> your own security review. The **escrow contract is the flagship**: it holds
> and moves real SEP-41 tokens end-to-end and is verified by a conservation
> property test. Marketplace royalties, multi-sig, and vesting have since
> gained real settlement too, DAO governance settles a SEP-41 proposal bond
> (pulled at `propose`, refunded or forfeited at a terminal transition), and
> subscriptions now bill each due period with a real subscriber → provider
> transfer with past-due retry — see the
> [Feature Status Matrix](docs/FEATURE-STATUS.md) and
> [Known Limitations](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) for exactly what is and is
> not done.

```

The workspace is a virtual Cargo workspace: each contract is its own crate so
it can be deployed and upgraded independently, while `shared-utils` and
`test-utils` keep error handling, storage patterns, and test harnesses DRY.

### Escrow lifecycle

Tests live inside each contract crate as Soroban `Env`-based test modules and
run through `cargo test --workspace`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

The workspace pins **stable Rust** and builds contracts for the
`wasm32v1-none` target required by soroban-sdk 27.x.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none          # needed to build contracts to WASM
cargo install soroban-cli                # optional: for deployment
```

### 2. Clone and verify

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meet-hybrid/soroban-forge.git
cd soroban-forge

cargo build --workspace --all-targets --locked   # compile everything
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked    # run the contract test suite
make lint                                        # fmt + clippy gates
```

### 3. Build a contract to WASM

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none -p soroban-forge-escrow
# → target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_forge_escrow.wasm
```

### 4. Use the developer CLI

```bash
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- --help
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- build --release
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- test --package soroban-forge-escrow

# New commands for contract interaction
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- invoke --contract <CONTRACT_ID> --function balance --network testnet
cargo run -p soroban-forge-cli -- events --contract <CONTRACT_ID> --since <LEDGER> --network testnet
```

### 5. Deploy to testnet

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/soroban_forge_escrow.wasm \
  --source-account <YOUR_KEYPAIR_NAME> \
  --network testnet
```

Then exercise the deployed contract with `stellar contract invoke` — e.g.
`create_escrow(buyer, seller, arbiter, token, amount, timeout)`, then
`deposit` (moves real tokens), `release`, `refund`, `dispute` + `resolve`,
or `cancel` per the lifecycle above.

## Development

```bash
make build         # cargo build --workspace --all-targets
make test          # cargo test --workspace --all-targets
make format        # cargo fmt --all
make lint          # cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
make audit         # cargo audit (requires cargo-audit)
make doc           # open rustdoc
```

### Regenerate the TypeScript clients

The six `packages/*-client` directories are generated bindings produced from
each contract's WASM. Regenerate them all from a clean local build with:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-clients.sh
```

This builds every contract for `wasm32v1-none` and runs the pinned Stellar
CLI's `stellar contract bindings typescript --wasm` for each one, wiping and
rewriting each package directory. Then build the packages:

```bash
(cd packages/typescript-sdk && npm install && npm run build)
(cd packages/nextjs-example && npm install && npm run build)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces: **Rustfmt · Clippy (-D warnings) ·
Build · Test · Security Audit · WASM Size Check**, with `--locked` for
reproducible builds and a per-contract WASM size budget.
