#![no_std]

//! # Soroban Forge — Marketplace Royalties contract
//!
//! Enforces creator royalty splits on secondary sales: when an NFT changes
//! hands, the sale proceeds are split between the seller and up to
//! [`MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS`] royalty recipients according to configured
//! basis-point rates. Each recipient's share is floored independently and
//! rounding dust remains with the seller; `settle_sale` moves the computed
//! split in real SEP-41 tokens.
//!
//! Flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! set_royalty(collection, recipient, bps)   -> one-recipient Active config
//! set_royalty_splits(collection, splits)    -> multi-recipient Active config
//! distribute(collection, token, payer,
//!             seller, amount)               -> transfers each floored royalty
//!                                              share from `payer`, returns the
//!                                              seller net with dust
//! settle_sale(collection, token, payer,
//!             seller, amount)               -> transfers the seller net, then
//!                                              the royalty share, then commits
//!                                              the settlement totals
//! settle_sales(collection, token, payer,
//!              sales: Vec<(seller, amount)>) -> validates the whole batch
//!                                              (config, cap, every amount,
//!                                              aggregate split math) before
//!                                              any token moves, runs each
//!                                              sale's seller-then-recipient
//!                                              transfers in sale order, and
//!                                              commits the aggregate totals
//!                                              exactly once
//! ```
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `set_royalty` requires the collection (the contract whose config this
//!   is), and `bps` must not exceed 100% (10_000 bps).
//! - `distribute` requires the collection (as `settle_sale` does) and the
//!   `payer`, whose authorization covers the nested royalty transfer to the
//!   configured recipient; it returns the seller's net after the configured
//!   royalty split, and a `Disabled` configuration settles in full by
//!   transferring nothing.
//! - `settle_sale` requires the collection (as `distribute` does) and the
//!   `payer`, whose balance funds both transfers; the payer's authorization
//!   covers the nested token invocations exactly as escrow's does.
//! - `settle_sales` has the same trust model as `settle_sale`: one
//!   collection authorization and one payer authorization cover every
//!   nested token transfer in the batch — no per-sale re-authorization.
//! - `get_royalty` and `get_settlement_summary` are read-only views.
//!
//! Settlement follows escrow's transfer-before-state ordering: all token
//! transfers run before any settlement state is committed, `settle_sale`
//! pays the royalty recipient last so a failed transfer can never leave it
//! partially paid, `distribute` pays only the royalty recipient (the
//! seller's net is the caller's responsibility), and token failures are
//! bucketed into `TokenTransferFailed`. Any returned error rolls the whole
//! invocation back. `settle_sales` extends that discipline to the batch:
//! every fallible step (configuration load, the [`MAX_SETTLE_SALES`] cap,
//! per-sale `amount > 0`, the per-sale split math, and the aggregate check
//! against the stored summary) runs before the first transfer, the summary
//! is written once per call, and a failure in any sale — including a later
//! sale's transfer — reverts the entire invocation, so no sale in the batch
//! is ever half-settled. Split vectors are stored in persistent storage under
//! a separate key from the legacy `Royalty` record. Legacy records without
//! that key are read as one-recipient configurations; a storage-breaking
//! upgrade must migrate those records before removing this fallback.
//! Per-token royalties remain out of scope.
