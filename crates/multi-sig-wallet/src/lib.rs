//! # Soroban Forge — Multi-signature Wallet contract
//!
//! A wallet that requires `threshold` approvals from a set of owners before a
//! transaction executes. The wallet is configured once via
//! [`SorobanForgeMultiSigWallet::initialize`]; transactions submitted by an
//! owner then collect confirmations from other owners until the threshold is
//! met, at which point [`SorobanForgeMultiSigWallet::execute`] completes them.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! submit --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed
//! submit --reject--> Rejected (terminal)
//! submit_call --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (+ typed call invoked)
//! submit_call --reject--> Rejected (terminal)
//! submit_withdrawal --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (+ tokens moved)
//! submit_withdrawal --reject--> Rejected (terminal)
//! set_withdrawal_limit --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (limit applied)
//! remove_withdrawal_limit --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (limit dropped)
//! add_owner --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (owner added)
//! remove_owner --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (owner removed)
//! set_threshold --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (threshold changed)
//! ```
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `initialize` sets the owner set and threshold once (guarded against
//!   re-initialisation).
//! - `submit` requires an owner and records a `target` contract address
//!   and an opaque `payload` for cross-contract invocation.
//! - `submit_call` requires an owner and records a typed cross-contract
//!   call with `target`, `function`, and `arguments`.
//! - `confirm` requires an owner that has not confirmed already.
//! - `reject` requires an owner that has not already signalled on the tx.
//! - `execute` may be called by anyone; it only succeeds once the threshold is
//!   met. For opaque-payload txs it performs a real cross-contract
//!   invocation to the recorded `target`. For typed call txs it invokes
//!   the specified function with arguments. For typed withdrawal txs it moves
//!   real tokens.
//! - A target revert surfaces as [`ForgeError::ContractInvocationFailed`]
//!   and leaves the transaction un-executed (status stays `Pending`).
//!
//! ## Owner-set and threshold governance
//!
//! The owner set and approval threshold are themselves governed by the same
//! machinery: `add_owner`, `remove_owner`, and `set_threshold` each record a
//! typed pending tx ([`TxKind::AddOwner`], [`TxKind::RemoveOwner`],
//! [`TxKind::SetThreshold`]) that must cross the **current** threshold
//! before `execute` applies it. No mutation happens at submission time, and
//! execution re-validates the resulting owner/threshold state before
//! writing anything:
//!
//! - `add_owner` rejects addresses already in the set at submission and
//!   again (against the live set) at execution.
//! - `remove_owner` rejects removal of a non-member or of the final owner at
//!   submission, and execution additionally refuses a removal that would
//!   leave `threshold > owners` — the wallet's approval invariant — so a
//!   valid submission can only fail at execution if the owner set changed
//!   underneath it.
//! - `set_threshold` requires `1 <= new_threshold <= owners.len()` at
//!   submission against the current set and again at execution against the
//!   resulting set. A threshold-change tx is authorized by the **old**
//!   threshold, and the new threshold is never retroactively applied to
//!   in-flight transactions.
//!
//! **Removed-owner confirmations are scrubbed.** When a removal executes,
//! every still-pending tx's confirmation list is rewritten to drop the
//! removed owner: a former owner's signature must not count towards a
//! threshold they can no longer be bound by. Only `Pending` txs are
//! touched, and a tx whose confirmations are all scrubbed simply needs the
//! surviving threshold anew.
//!
//! **Atomicity.** All three mutations validate the resulting state before
//! writing, and the tx is marked `Executed` only after the mutation
//! succeeds. A failed execution leaves the tx `Pending` and the wallet
//! state exactly as it was.
//!
//! ## Rejection policy
//!
//! An owner who spots a malicious or mistaken pending transaction records a
//! formal objection via `reject`. Rejections are stored on the tx record
//! (`WalletTx::rejections`) alongside confirmations. The policy:
//!
//! - **A signed owner may signal once, in one direction.** An owner who
//!   confirmed cannot also reject the same tx, and an owner who rejected
//!   cannot confirm it (`InvalidInput`). A combined signal would be
//!   ambiguous.
//! - **Existing confirmations do not block rejection.** The whole point of
//!   the entrypoint is to stop a tx that already reached (or is approaching)
//!   the threshold, so an owner can reject a tx others have confirmed.
//! - **Any rejection blocks execution.** `execute` refuses a tx that carries
//!   even one rejection, below or at the threshold — a single formal
//!   objection stalls the tx. That is load-bearing: without it, rejections
//!   below the threshold would be a no-op and a threshold-met malicious tx
//!   would still execute.
//! - **One rejection is terminal.** Any owner may veto a pending tx; the
//!   status flips to `Rejected` immediately, retaining existing confirmations
//!   and the rejector for audit. No further confirms, executes, or rejects
//!   are accepted.
//! - **Terminal operations fail without mutation.** `confirm`, `reject`, and
//!   `execute` return [`ForgeError::InvalidInput`] for a `Rejected` tx and
//!   leave its stored record unchanged.
//! - **Executed txs can never be rejected** (there is nothing to stop), and
//!   rejections are never revoked (un-confirm is out of scope).
//!
//! ## Custody model
//!
//! The wallet custodies SEP-41 token balances. Anyone (an owner or a
//! third party) can `deposit` into the wallet by pull transfer; only a
//! threshold-approved withdrawal can move funds out. Open deposits are a
//! deliberate choice: a wallet that can only receive from its owners is a
//! strict subset of one that accepts direct funding, and custody risk is
//! unchanged because every exit is multisig-gated. The wallet must be
//! initialized before deposits are accepted — funding an uninitialized
//! wallet would strand the tokens behind a contract with no owners and no
//! exit.
//!
//! A withdrawal is a transaction like any other: `submit_withdrawal` records
//! a typed [`Withdrawal`] (token, destination, amount) as a `Pending` tx that
//! collects confirmations; `execute` moves the tokens to the destination and
//! flips the status only past the threshold. Withdrawal validity is checked
//! at execution time, not submission time — the balance can change between
//! the two, so a submitted withdrawal is an intent, not a reservation.
//!
//! Three transaction kinds coexist by design:
//! - **Opaque-payload txs** (`submit`) keep the `payload` `Bytes` untouched
//!   for arbitrary transaction bodies; dispatching those bytes is out of
//!   scope here.
//! - **Typed call txs** (`submit_call`) carry a structured function call
//!   with target address, function name, and arguments as `Vec<Val>`.
//! - **Typed withdrawal txs** (`submit_withdrawal`) carry an empty `payload`
//!   and a [`TxKind::Withdrawal`] record instead. Encoding withdrawals into
//!   the opaque payload was rejected because the contract would need a
//!   payload codec to validate and execute them natively; a typed record
//!   lets the contract validate amount/destination semantics directly and
//!   keeps the `payload` free for genuinely arbitrary txs. The tradeoff is
//!   that withdrawals are a first-class tx kind rather than uninterpreted
//!   bytes.
//!
//! ## Withdrawal limits (per-token rolling windows)
//!
//! The owner threshold alone bounds *who* authorises an exit, not *how much*
//! can leave: any threshold-approved withdrawal can drain custody in full.
//! A [`WithdrawalLimit`] caps how much of one token may leave custody within
//! a rolling window, so a compromised or mistaken quorum cannot move an
//! unbounded amount before anyone can object. Larger transfers need their
//! own governance process — raise or remove the limit, which is itself a
//! threshold-gated transaction.
//!
//! Three decisions define the model:
//!
//! - **Enforced at submission, not execution.** A `submit_withdrawal` whose
//!   amount would push the token's in-window total past the limit is
//!   rejected immediately with [`ForgeError::WithdrawalLimitExceeded`],
//!   distinct from `InvalidInput` so a caller can tell "valid but too large
//!   right now" from a malformed argument. The limit is an *admission gate
//!   on the approval queue*: a withdrawal that could never be authorised
//!   should never consume an owner's signature, and a rejected submission
//!   leaves no partial state to unwind. This deliberately diverges from the
//!   balance check above, which stays at execution time because custody can
//!   move underneath a pending tx; a limit is a policy the owners set on
//!   purpose and cannot drift on its own.
//! - **A withdrawal counts from its submission time until
//!   `submission + window` elapses**, whether or not it ever executes, and
//!   pending withdrawals count alongside executed ones. Reserving window
//!   capacity at submission is what makes the cap meaningful: otherwise a
//!   quorum could stage many pending withdrawals that individually fit and
//!   collectively drain the wallet once confirmed. An entry is in-window
//!   while `now - submitted_at < window`, so it leaves the window exactly
//!   at `submitted_at + window`.
//! - **Execution does not re-validate the limit.** Only funding is
//!   re-checked at execution. The tradeoff is explicit: a limit *reduction*
//!   never strands already-approved withdrawals (the safer failure mode for
//!   funds that owners have already signed for), but an in-flight withdrawal
//!   authorised under a higher limit still executes after a reduction. The
//!   blast-radius cap applies to what can be *proposed*; owners lowering a
//!   limit to stop a specific pending withdrawal must `reject` it, which
//!   immediately makes the transaction terminal.
//!   Re-checking at execution instead would double-count the window (once
//!   at submission, once at execution) and would make every reduction
//!   silently void outstanding approvals.
//!
//! **Accounting structure.** In-window usage is a compact per-token list of
//! [`WindowEntry`] records pruned on every read and write, not a bucketed
//! accumulator. The list is exact at the window boundary, which is what the
//! boundary semantics above require; a bucketed accumulator is O(1) per
//! read but can only approximate the total inside a bucket, which would
//! blur exactly the `submitted_at + window` edge the model is built on. The
//! cost is bounded and acceptable: the list holds one entry per withdrawal
//! inside a single window for one token, and it is pruned on the next
//! read/write for that token, so an idle token's list does not grow.
//!
//! Limits are absent by default, so a token with no configured limit
//! constrains nothing and `submit_withdrawal` behaves exactly as it did
//! before limits existed (no usage is recorded and no check runs).
//! Removing a limit drops the policy but not the recorded window history:
//! usage describes the token's withdrawal history, not the policy, and a
//! later limit is then measured against the withdrawals already in its
//! window — the conservative direction.
//!
//! The read-only views `get_withdrawal_limit`, `get_withdrawal_window`, and
//! `check_withdrawal` expose the current policy, active usage and projected
//! expiry, and a simulation of the submission policy plus current funding.
//! Missing policy/window data (including for an uninitialized wallet or an
//! unknown token) is represented as `None` or an empty window; the check
//! reports `WalletNotInitialized` for an uninitialized wallet. These views
//! do not prune entries or write storage. The limit is enforced at withdrawal
//! submission as an admission gate, not rechecked when the pending tx executes.

//!
//! ## Ordering discipline (load-bearing)
//!
//! Every method that moves tokens performs the token transfer **first** and
//! writes state **after** the transfer succeeds. A failed transfer reverts
//! the whole invocation with balances and tx state untouched — there is no
//! state/ledger divergence window and no recovery path needed. The inverse
//! ordering (state first, transfer second) would strand funds behind a
//! failed transfer and is the classic custody bug.
//!
//! ## Token trust model
//!
//! `deposit` accepts a user-specified token address. The contract does not
//! verify that the address is a deployed token contract or enforce SEP-41
//! compliance; it assumes the supplied token follows the expected SEP-41
//! interface and behavior. Token transfer failures use the existing
//! `TokenTransferFailed` error path, so a malicious or non-compliant token
//! is an external trust assumption rather than something the wallet
//! validates.
//!
//! ## Storage and TTL
//!
//! Token balances live in **per-token persistent entries**
//! (`DataKey::Balance(token)`), not instance storage, mirroring the escrow
//! crate's rationale: persistent entries scale the byte budget per record
//! instead of taxing every instance read (the owner set, threshold, and tx
//! records) with custody data that grows with the number of custodied
//! tokens, and persistent entries carry their own extensible TTL so a
//! long-idle balance does not silently expire the way archived instance
//! storage would force a full-state restore. Every balance write bumps the
//! entry's TTL with the standard threshold/extend pattern, and `touch_ttl`
//! is a permissionless keeper entrypoint for balances that sit idle near
//! expiry.
//!
//! Transaction records (`DataKey::Tx(tx_id)`) migrated to **persistent
//! storage** for the same reason: instance storage is byte-budgeted as one
//! shared entry that every read taxes, while persistent entries scale per
//! record and carry their own extensible TTL. Every tx write bumps the
//! entry's TTL with the standard threshold/extend pattern, and
//! `touch_tx_ttl` is a permissionless keeper entrypoint for long-lived
//! pending txs that approach expiry. A tx whose TTL lapses is no longer
//! present — reads return [`ForgeError::NotFound`] and the record cannot be
//! revived, though the id counter (`DataKey::Count`) is untouched. The
//! `Owners`/`Threshold`/`Count` keys stay in instance storage: they are
//! small, hot, written by the existing entrypoints, and their semantics are
//! unchanged by this storage layer.
//!
//! The withdrawal-limit keys follow the same split for the same reasons.
//! `DataKey::WithdrawalLimit(token)` holds one small policy record, and
//! `DataKey::WindowUsage(token)` holds the rolling-window list, which grows
//! and shrinks with withdrawal activity and is pruned on read/write. Both
//! are custody-adjacent policy *and* accounting data scoped to a single
//! token: neither belongs in the shared instance entry, and neither should
//! expire on the instance's TTL. Every write to either bumps its own entry
//! with the same threshold/extend pattern as balances.
